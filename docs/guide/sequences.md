# Sequences & timing

`GameTestSequence` schedules actions on future test ticks. Use it when a test needs to do something, wait a bit, then check the result.

## Basic usage

```java
@GameTest(template = "stone_platform", timeoutTicks = 60)
public static void delayedAssert(GameTestHelper helper) {
    helper.startSequence()
        .thenIdle(10)
        .thenExecute(() -> helper.assertBlockPresent(helper.absolute(0, 0, 0), Blocks.stone))
        .thenSucceed();
}
```

One sequence per test. For an immediate pass use `helper.succeed()` directly.

## Methods

| Method                                     | Phase | What it does                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `thenIdle(n)`                              |       | Skip `n` ticks                                  |
| `thenExecute(Runnable)`                    | END   | Run once at scheduled tick                      |
| `thenExecuteAtStart(Runnable)`             | START | Run once at scheduled tick, before world tick   |
| `thenExecuteAtEnd(Runnable)`               | END   | Alias of `thenExecute`                          |
| `thenExecuteFor(n, Runnable)`              | END   | Run every tick for `n` ticks                    |
| `thenExecuteForAtStart(n, Runnable)`       | START | Same, before world tick                         |
| `thenExecuteForAtEnd(n, Runnable)`         | END   | Alias of `thenExecuteFor`                       |
| `thenWaitUntil(Runnable)`                  | END   | Retry each tick until runnable does not throw   |
| `thenWaitUntilAtStart(Runnable)`           | START | Same, before world tick                         |
| `thenWaitUntil(maxTicks, Runnable)`        | END   | Same, reserve up to `maxTicks` ticks             |
| `thenWaitUntilAtStart(maxTicks, Runnable)` | START | Same, before world tick                         |
| `thenSucceed()`                            | END   | Pass the test                                   |
| `thenFail(msg)`                            | END   | Fail the test                                   |

## Tick phases

Every server tick has a START phase and an END phase. World logic (tile entity updates, hopper transfers, machine processing) runs between them.

Default sequence methods run at END, so assertions see the world after it has ticked. Use the `AtStart` variants to deliver input before the world ticks, which is what you want when testing machines that consume their input during the tick.

```java
// insert at START so the machine sees it during the tick, assert at END
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecuteAtStart(() -> ioport.setInventorySlotContents(0, cell.copy()))
    .thenExecute(() -> {
        helper.assertNull(ioport.getStackInSlot(0));
        helper.assertTrue(ItemStack.areItemStacksEqual(ioport.getStackInSlot(6), cell));
    })
    .thenSucceed();
```

### Phase ordering

Within one scheduled tick, START must come before END. The builder throws `IllegalStateException` if you try to go the other way:

```java
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecute(assertion)
    .thenExecuteAtStart(stimulus);  // throws -- can't go back to START
```

Use `thenIdle(1)` to push the START event to the next tick:

```java
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecute(assertion)
    .thenIdle(1)
    .thenExecuteAtStart(nextStimulus);
```

## Setup code and `startSequence`

The test body runs immediately when the test starts, before the first counted tick. A leading `thenExecuteAtStart` runs at START of tick 1, and a leading `thenExecute` runs at END of tick 1. Structural setup usually belongs before `startSequence()` so the sequence can focus on stimulus and assertions:

```java
@GameTest(template = "stone_platform")
public static void example(GameTestHelper helper) {
    helper.setBlock(0, 1, 0, Blocks.chest);
    helper.startSequence()
        .thenWaitUntil(() -> helper.assertBlockPresent(helper.absolute(0, 1, 0), Blocks.chest))
        .thenSucceed();
}
```

## `thenIdle` counts ticks, not gaps

Ticks are author-facing and 1-based. `thenIdle(1)` advances one counted tick from the current sequence point; between two events, that means the next event lands on the next tick.

END-phase sequence actions scheduled on the timeout boundary are evaluated before the test is marked timed out. For example, `thenIdle(40).thenSucceed()` passes at END of tick 40 with `timeoutTicks = 40`.

START-phase actions after an initial idle run before the next world tick after that many ticks have elapsed. For example, `thenIdle(40).thenExecuteAtStart(...)` targets START of tick 41, so it is outside a `timeoutTicks = 40` window.

## Assertions inside thenExecute

Throw any `AssertionError` subclass. It propagates through the sequence and fails the test with the usual position context.

## Prefer state polling over fixed delays

```java
.thenWaitUntil(500, () -> gtnh.assertMachineFormed(controller))
```

is more reliable than `thenIdle(fixedRecipeLength)`. See [Design principle 4](../contributing/principles.md).

## Interaction with warp

`runRecipe` and `fastForwardTicks` advance the event recorder clock, not the sequence scheduler. The two clocks are independent. When reading timing logs, check which clock an event came from before drawing conclusions.

## Choosing the right tool

|                    | Use when                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onEachTick`       | Something must hold true on every tick until the test ends |
| `GameTestSequence` | Steps need to happen in order with delays between them     |
| `succeedWhen`      | Waiting for a single condition to become true              |
