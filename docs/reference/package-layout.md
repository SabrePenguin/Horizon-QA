# Package layout

Convention for **consumer mods** adding GameTests. This page is not about classes inside the Horizon-QA jar itself; for that, see [Framework internals](#framework-internals-contributors) below.

## Test code

Mirror the **system under test**, not the implementing Java class:

```text
src/main/java/<base>/tests/
  multiblock/<machine-name>/     ← single-mod multiblock tests
  compatibility/<modA>_<modB>/   ← cross-mod scenarios
```

!!! warning "Avoid a flat `tests/` package"

    A flat dump does not scale once a modpack has 50 tests across 10 mods. Group by what is being verified (a machine, a compatibility surface) so a reviewer can find the relevant tests without grepping.

The `examples/` directory in **this repository** is reserved for framework demonstrations. Do not copy that name into a production mod as a generic catch-all bucket.

## Structure assets

```text
src/main/resources/assets/<modid>/horizonqastructures/
  <path>.json
  <path>_tiles.nbt
```

Template reference: `@GameTest(template = "path")` with `@GameTestHolder("<modid>")` resolves to `<modid>:path`.

## Test ids and CI

Test ids appear in:

- `/horizonqa run <id>`
- `TEST-horizonqa.xml`
- Console batch summaries

Keep the holder `value` equal to your mod id unless you have a strong reason to namespace tests separately; diverging makes results harder to trace back from CI.
